                            Service Users, and will remain the same in the future as well, to find, use, or avail
                            the desired Services.</p>
                        <h4>SERVICE PROVIDERS</h4>
                        <p>To display, publish or post about the Services offered by You (Service Provider), on the
                            ZeroBrokage Website and/or App, a minimum chargeable fee is applicable.</p>
                        <h4>FEES</h4>
                        <p>ZeroBrokage requires Service Providers to make payments (“Fees”) to be able to respond
                            or reply to Lead Requests posted, and to contact Service Users, irrespective of whether
                            the Lead Request eventually results or converts into a confirmed transaction or not.</p>
                        <p>ZeroBrokage requires Service Providers to make at least 1 Lead Request purchase every
                            month (4 weeks).</p>
                        <h4>CREDITS</h4>
                        <p>Service Providers are required to make advance payments (“Credits”) from which the Fees
                            will be deducted as and when necessary.</p>
                        <p>ZeroBrokage also requires Service Providers to maintain a minimum Credit limit in the

                            Requests until they replenish the Credits. Therefore, Service Providers must ensure to
                            refill Credits regularly, to be able to follow up on Service User Requests unhindered in
                            the future.</p>
                        <p>ZeroBrokage will not be liable to any Service Provider in the event that the Service
                            Provider is unable to convert the Service User Request into a confirmed transaction for
                            any reason or if the Service Provider is unable to respond or contact the Service User
                            due to an exhausted Credit limit.</p>
                        <h4>SMS CHARGES</h4>
