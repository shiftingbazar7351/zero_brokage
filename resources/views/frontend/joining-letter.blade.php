                                productivity, quality of work, teamwork, initiative, and adherence to company policies

                                the extent to which the employee's performance falls short of the established standards.
                                Deductions may be applied to bonuses, incentives, or other forms of compensation, as
                                deemed appropriate by the company.</p>
